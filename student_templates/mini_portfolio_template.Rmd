- Goal: recreate and improve a chart you like
- Skills: ggplot2, data wrangling

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
df <- readr::read_csv("../data/example.csv")
ggplot(df, aes(year, value, color = group)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point() + theme_minimal()
```
