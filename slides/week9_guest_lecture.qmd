## Why a Portfolio?

- Your projects are your **Google results**.
- Portfolios communicate: skills, taste, reliability.
- R + Quarto let you **publish** quickly.

---

## What Employers Look For

- Clear **story** + clean **visuals**
- Reproducibility (code & data)
- Small, **shippable** demos (sites, dashboards)

---

## Demo Plan

1. A clean ggplot (static)
2. An interactive chart
3. A minimal **Quarto website**

---

## Static → Interactive → Website

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

df <- readr::read_csv("../data/example.csv")
ggplot(df, aes(year, value, group = group)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Example time series", x = NULL, y = NULL)
```

---

## One-Minute Site

```bash
quarto create-project mysite --type website
cd mysite
quarto preview
```

- Edit `index.qmd` to add your plot
- Publish with GitHub Pages

---

## Takeaways

- Start small, ship often
- Make it **searchable** (GitHub, Pages)
- Tell the story behind each figure
