## Overview

This repository hosts the teaching materials for a guest lecture delivered as part of **EDC101: Data Visualisation** at the University of Sheffield.  
The session explores how **data visualisation can be used as a tool for personal branding**, combining action, application, mindset, and reproducible skills.

The lecture aims to help students:

- Recognise the role of **data storytelling** in employability and digital identity.  
- Build an initial **personal website** and **GitHub portfolio**.  
- Move from *“I haven’t done it”* → *“I made a demo”* by producing small, visible outputs.  
- Apply **open-source tools** (R Markdown / Quarto, GitHub, Shiny) to publish reproducible work.
